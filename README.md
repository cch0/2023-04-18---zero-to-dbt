# Welcome to zero to dbt from dbt Labs!
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate common patterns and use cases for dbt!!

We're going to get hands on, do some rapid learning, and get your soaring on your dbt journey!

Quick Resources:
- Learn more about dbt [in the docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)
- Check out [Discourse](https://discourse.getdbt.com/) for commonly asked questions and answers
- Join the [chat](http://slack.getdbt.com/) on Slack for live discussions and best practices
- Find [dbt events](https://events.getdbt.com) near you

Would you rather just get started with dbt Cloud and skip the lab? [Just say hello and we'll take it from there.](https://getdbt.com/contact)


## Prework!

Before we get started on this journey, you will be asked to setup your dbt account. Don't worry, thanks to hard work from many wonderful people you are able to do this in 10 painless minutes.

In this prework section, we will create a Snowflake account (if you don‚Äôt already have one) and create a dbt Cloud account directly from Snowflake.

If you already have a Snowflake account, please skip the Snowflake account creation steps and go straight to creating a dbt Cloud account using partner connect. 

**NOTE** if you've already set up a Snowflake Partner Connect dbt Cloud account, you might have some errors trying this - in that case, go ahead and create a new Snowflake trial below and use that for this training.


### To create a Snowflake account:

1. Go to the [Snowflake website](https://signup.snowflake.com) and click "Free Trial" in the top-right corner.
2. Fill out the required information and click "Create Account".
3. Follow the instructions in your email to activate your account.
4. Once your account is activated, log in to your Snowflake account.

### To create a dbt Cloud account using Partner Connect:

1. Log in to Snowflake and make sure you‚Äôre using the `ACCOUNTADMIN` role.
2. In the Snowflake UI, click the "Partner Connect" button in the top-right corner.
3. Select "dbt Cloud".
4. Follow the prompts to create your dbt Cloud account.
5. You should receive an email from dbt Cloud confirming your account creation. You may now log in to dbt Cloud and see your fresh project!

## That‚Äôs it for now!

üéâ¬†Congratulations on making it through the hardest part of zero to dbt! And thank you SO much for taking your first concrete steps to learning dbt ‚ô•Ô∏è
